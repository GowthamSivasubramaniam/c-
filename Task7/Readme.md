# Asynchronous Programming and Multi-threadingObjective:Requirements:

## Objective
- Develop a console application that performs multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.
- Use `async` and `await` to fetch data from multiple simulated sources (e.g., using `Task.Delay` to mimic API calls).
- Aggregate the results once all tasks are complete.
- Handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations.
